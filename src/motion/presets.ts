 *   · every movement — the page push (382 → 0 while the page under it goes 0 → −200), rows and blocks (20px) — rides one
 *     spring: stiffness 280.6, damping 27.14 (ω 16.75 rad/s, ζ 0.81, 1.3% overshoot, settled ≈ 0.547s)
 *   · fades in: a fast-start ease-out, 183ms (276ms long); fades out / chips / skeletons: an S-curve, 189ms (388ms long)
 *   · stagger 60ms in (top → bottom), 40ms out (bottom → top)
 * The bezier curves below are fits of those recorded curves (ease-out ≤1.3%, S-curve ≤0.2%, spring shape ≤3.7%) so
 * they also work in CSS; `handoff` (further down) keeps the exact sampled curves. Press feedback (`spring.press`),
 * playful pops (`spring.bouncy`, `easing.backOut`) and `duration.instant` have no counterpart in Test01 and are kept.
